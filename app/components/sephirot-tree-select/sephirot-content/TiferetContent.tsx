        <p>
          Tiferet acts as the central hub of the Sephirot Tree, connecting all other sephirots and harmonizing their energies. 
          Associated with the 3rd chakra's fire energy and the heart center, it serves as a channel for integrating personal, emotional, and spiritual energy. 
          When active, it ignites the Sephirot Tree like a living flame, creating radiance, harmony, and vitality throughout the energy system.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned and humble, Tiferet allows energy to flow in perfect harmony through the Sephirot Tree. 
          It radiates beauty, compassion, and balance, fostering integration of emotions, intellect, and spirit. 
          A person feels centered, inspired, and connected to themselves and the world around them.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          If the ego dominates, Tiferet becomes distorted, unbalancing the flow of energy between sephirots. 
          The central hub may burn too intensely or be blocked, creating emotional turbulence, pride, or a disconnection from one’s heart and higher purpose.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          Practices that nurture Tiferet include heart-centered meditation, conscious breathwork, and gentle chest-opening movements. 
          Cultivating compassion, gratitude, and mindfulness helps maintain the balance and radiant energy of this central sephira.
