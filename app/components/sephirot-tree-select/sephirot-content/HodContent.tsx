        <p>
          Hod governs the reception, refinement, and distribution of energy from the physical plane to the other sephirots. 
          It acts as a processing center, organizing energy for balanced flow throughout the system.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned with humility, Hod allows energy to move freely, maintaining harmony and clarity. 
          This enables constructive communication, precise mental processing, and smooth coordination of physical and emotional energies.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When ego or external pressures dominate, Hod may be overloaded with dense, dark energy, disrupting its natural rhythm. 
          This can create tension, confusion, or blockages that hinder the flow to other sephirots, affecting both emotional and physical balance.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To maintain Hod's function, practice clarity in thought and speech, release tension in the hips and lower body, 
          and allow energy to circulate without forcing it. Mindful posture, meditation, and conscious breathing help keep this sephira active and balanced.
