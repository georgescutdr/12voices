        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Function</p>
        <p>
          Chokhmah processes incoming energy and information, computing it according to natural patterns, principles, and universal laws. 
          It governs intuitive understanding, insight, and the ability to perceive order within complexity.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When balanced and humble, Chokhmah allows clear, unobstructed perception. 
          Wisdom flows naturally, allowing one to recognize patterns and respond with insight, creativity, and common sense. 
          Decisions are guided by clarity and alignment with universal principles.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When dominated by ego or distortion, Chokhmah is clouded by dense, dark energy. 
          This can lead to ignorance, biased reasoning, and the construction of false narratives. 
          Lies, excuses, and self-deception arise when this sphere is obstructed, disconnecting the mind from natural order and geometric truth.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To maintain clarity in Chokhmah, cultivate humility, meditation, and reflection. 
          Avoid mental patterns driven by ego or fear. Gentle exercises for the right side of the head, brain visualization techniques, or mindful observation of thoughts can help preserve the natural flow of wisdom and intuition.
