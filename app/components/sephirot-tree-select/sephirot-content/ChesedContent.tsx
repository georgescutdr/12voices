        <p>
          Chesed processes and distributes energy flowing from the feminine sephirots, embodying grace, compassion, and generosity. 
          It governs the capacity to give without expectation, create harmonious relationships, and extend love and support outwardly while maintaining inner balance.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When functioning naturally, Chesed radiates energy gracefully and unobtrusively. 
          It enhances empathy, kindness, and the ability to nurture others and oneself. 
          This sphere supports harmonious social interactions, inspiring generosity and a sense of interconnectedness.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When influenced by ego or unbalanced emotions, Chesed can become saturated with dense, dark energy. 
          This may manifest as emotional manipulation, excessive control, or the projection of negativity onto others. 
          Energetic blockages here can cause feelings of overwhelm, emotional burnout, or the inability to receive or give love authentically.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To harmonize Chesed, practice mindful compassion, set healthy boundaries, and engage in acts of kindness without expectation. 
          Energy work, gentle stretches, or massage around the right shoulder can help maintain the natural flow of this sephira, supporting emotional balance and the capacity to give and receive love freely.
