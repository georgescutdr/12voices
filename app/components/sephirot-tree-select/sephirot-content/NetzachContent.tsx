        <p>
          Netzach is the sephira that emits and radiates energy outward into the environment. 
          It acts as a channel for the energy received from higher sephirots, transmitting it gracefully and effectively. 
          It is closely linked with the endurance, persistence, and outward manifestation of personal and spiritual energy.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned and functioning naturally, Netzach allows energy to flow effortlessly and harmoniously into the surroundings. 
          The person radiates vitality, positivity, and influence without force or interference, creating a natural and balanced effect on others.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          If the ego dominates, Netzach can be overloaded with dense, dark energy. 
          This causes the sphere to become aggressive and intrusive, projecting energy forcefully, potentially causing harm or conflict in the environment. 
          The natural grace of emanation is lost, replaced by compulsion or domination.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To keep Netzach healthy, focus on practices that allow energy to flow without force, such as gentle movement, dance, or breathwork. 
          Mindful intention ensures that the energy emitted is balanced, sustaining both personal endurance and a positive influence on your surroundings.
