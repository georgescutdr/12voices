        <p>
          Gevurah governs strength, discipline, and the structuring of energy within our emotional and physical bodies. 
          It provides the necessary boundaries, density, and power to regulate the flow of life force and emotional energy.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When balanced and humble, Gevurah acts as a gate that channels energy efficiently, fostering resilience, courage, and constructive action. 
          It strengthens emotional control and allows one to act decisively without being overpowered by impulses.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          If dominated by ego or anger, this sephira accumulates dense, heavy energy, creating rigidity, aggression, and emotional volatility. 
          Over time, this blocks the natural flow of energy and may manifest as physical tension, harshness, or destructive tendencies.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To maintain Gevurah’s clarity, practice mindful discipline, controlled physical movement, and conscious emotional management. 
          Regularly releasing tension and observing one’s impulses helps prevent the buildup of dense, negative energy and keeps the sphere flowing harmoniously.
