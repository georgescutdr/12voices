        <p>
          Keter represents the highest level of consciousness and spiritual connection. 
          It is the gateway through which universal energy, divine insight, and higher wisdom flow into the human system. 
          Keter integrates all other sephirots, serving as a crown that unifies mind, body, and spirit.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned with humility and surrender, Keter allows the individual to experience profound spiritual awareness, 
          insight, and a sense of unity with the Universe. It serves as a lens for perceiving higher truths, inspiration, and universal guidance.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When ego dominates, Keter becomes blocked or disconnected from higher consciousness. 
          This results in spiritual disorientation, self-centeredness, and the replacement of divine insight with illusions or rigid, ego-driven thinking.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To support Keter, practice meditation, mindfulness, and surrender to higher wisdom. 
          Opening the crown through quiet reflection and spiritual practice helps maintain a clear channel for universal energy and insight, 
          ensuring balance across all other sephirots.
