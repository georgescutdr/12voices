        <p>
          Daat is the hidden sephira that bridges wisdom (Chokhmah) and understanding (Binah), integrating knowledge into conscious experience. 
          It governs awareness, perception, and the deep understanding of life’s underlying truths.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned and balanced, Daat allows knowledge to flow seamlessly into action and insight. 
          This leads to intuitive understanding, the ability to perceive hidden connections, and a sense of internal coherence between thought, emotion, and experience.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When blocked or clouded by ego, fear, or confusion, Daat accumulates dense, stagnant energy. 
          This creates illusions, self-deception, and inability to synthesize knowledge correctly. 
          One may experience mental chaos, indecision, and disconnection from inner guidance.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To maintain Daat’s clarity, practice meditation, reflection, and mindful observation. 
          Focusing on the center of the head and the third eye area, cultivating humility and detachment from ego-driven thought, helps integrate wisdom and understanding naturally into your life.
