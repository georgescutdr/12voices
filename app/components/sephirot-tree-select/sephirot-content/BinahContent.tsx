        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Function</p>
        <p>
          Binah continuously receives, processes, and organizes informational energy. 
          It acts as the analytical and structuring force of the mind, giving shape and comprehension to ideas, observations, and insights. 
          It helps discern patterns, understand complexity, and integrate knowledge with wisdom.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When functioning naturally, Binah receives information without interference or judgment. 
          Humility and observation allow the mind to process knowledge clearly, maintain emotional balance, and generate constructive understanding. 
          It fosters deep insight, patience, and the ability to synthesize diverse sources of information into wisdom.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When influenced by ego, Binah becomes charged with dense magnetic or distorted energy. 
          Instead of understanding, it seeks control over information, creating biased interpretations, manipulations, and artificial mental constructs. 
          This leads to confusion, obsessive thinking, and misaligned actions. 
          Blockages in this sphere can manifest as rigidity in thought, paranoia, or difficulty accepting alternative perspectives.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          To harmonize Binah, practice mindful observation and detachment from judgment. 
          Engage in meditation, journaling, or reflective thinking that prioritizes understanding over control. 
          Physically, gentle stretches and energy work on the left shoulder area can support the natural flow of this sphere.
