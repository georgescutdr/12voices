        <p>
          Yesod acts as the foundational sphere of the Sephirot Tree, connecting the spiritual energies of the upper sephirots to the physical realm.
          Located in the pelvic area, it channels the tree's energy into tangible form, giving structure and manifestation to thought, emotion, and spiritual intention.

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Positive Charge</p>
        <p>
          When aligned and functioning naturally, Yesod ensures that energies are expressed in constructive, balanced ways.
          It governs the proper manifestation of personal will, creativity, and emotional grounding, supporting stability in both body and life circumstances.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Negative Charge</p>
        <p>
          When dominated by ego, laziness, or greed, Yesod becomes congested with dark, dense energy.
          This transforms it into a vortex of consumption or uncontrolled manifestation, disrupting the flow of energy to the rest of the tree and causing imbalance in physical, emotional, and mental states.
        </p>

        <p className="font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Practical Insight</p>
        <p>
          Practices that strengthen Yesod include grounding exercises, pelvic and lower-abdomen energy work, mindful movement, and conscious connection to physical needs and desires.
          Cultivating discipline, moderation, and awareness helps maintain a stable foundation for all other sephirots.
